## About 
Simple extension that provides math and other utility functions for arcade makecode alongside exposing useful commands to blocks.

### Whats implemented:
* **PI** – Allows you to retrieve the value of pi without manually typing it in.
* **Distance Calculator** – Allows you to calculate the distance between two positions.
* **Angle Calculator** – Allows you to calculate the angle between two positions.
* **Radians** – Converts a given angle to radians.
* **Degrees** – Converts the given radians back into degrees.
* **Clamp** – Limits a value within a specified range.
* **RaycastTileMap** – Raycasts in a direction to retrieve tile map data, such as whether a wall or sprite is within the area.
* **Velocity** – Calculates the velocity for a position using the provided speed and angle.
* **Angle Position** – Returns the new position based on a given angle, distance, and starting position.

So now i don't have to keep writing all these commands manually each time lol.
